# Marketing-Campaign-Analysis

This project is a part of the Master of Quantitative Management: Business Analytics. I was working on a data analysis project to design a model-based targeting strategy for a retail company to target right customers as well as maximize campaign utility. Using LASSO as a method of dimension reduction, and logistic regression, decision tree, and random forest as models.
